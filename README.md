# UMI3D-Browser-Desktop
UMI3D is a web protocol that enables the creation of 3D media in which users of any AR/VR device can collaborate in real time. The 3D media is created once and hosted on a server or on a local computer. Any AR/VR device can display and interact with it remotely thanks to a dedicated UMI3D browser. 

This git is an implementation of an UMI3D desktop browser with [Unity](https://unity.com) for Windows
